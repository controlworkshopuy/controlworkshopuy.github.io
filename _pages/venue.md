## Getting around:

Uber works fine in Uruguay (but don't expect US sized cars). To get from the airport to the University/Hotel, Uber is the best choice. Be advised that, upon arrival at the airport, you have to go *upstairs to the departure level* to wait for your ride. There is a designated spot exiting the terminal towards the right where ride-share app drivers will meet you.
