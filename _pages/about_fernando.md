Fernando obtained his B.S degrees in Mathematics and Engineering from Universidad de la República, Uruguay. He then graduated with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Caltech, where his PhD thesis received the 1996 Wilts Prize and the 1996 Clauser Prize. From 1996 to 1997 he was a postdoctoral associate at MIT. Between 1997 and 2005 he was on the faculty the Electrical Engineering Department at UCLA, reaching the rank of Associate Professor. Since 2005 he is Professor of Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering at Universidad ORT Uruguay, and currently Vice-Dean of Research. 

Among other distinctions, he received the 1995 O. Hugo Schuck Best Paper Award, the 1999 Packard Fellowship, the 2004 George S. Axelby Best Paper Award. He is also member of the Uruguayan National Academy of Sciences, the Uruguayan National Academy of Engineering, and the Latin American Academy of Sciences. During the pandemic he served in Uruguay as one of three coordinators of the Honorary Scientific Advisory Group on Covid-19, receiving after the Presidency of the Republic Award. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and IFAC (2023).

Over the years he has made substantial contributions to Control Theory, in particular Robust Control, Congestion Control on the Internet and Energy Systems. He also advised several PhD and Master students. But above everything, he has spent his entire career thriving for mathematical rigor in research, as well as establishing links with several important applications.

Most importantly, he has been a model of intellectual rigor and down-to-earth friendship for all who have worked with him.

He turned 60 recently, and this is why we are holding this event! We hope we have a good time celebrating his contributions and his friendship in Montevideo!
